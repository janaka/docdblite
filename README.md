# DocDbLite

Embedded document database. Inspired by MongoDB. Built on top of Sqlite.

For fans of Sqlite and it's simple embedded approach, there's no document oriented database equivalent. DocDbLite is that option.

This is currently a prototype implemented purely in Python. The idea would be to convert this to a more language agnostic state, similar to Sqlite itself, using C, C++, or Rust which all support Foreign Function Interface (FFI).
